# Data folder

Here go all the data files used in the analysis.

### Roadmap

* The folder `remesas` contains data from the Presidential election. Each file name starts with `REMESAS`. The rest of the file names corresponds to a code `0100`, the day (`01` or `02`), and the time in `hhmm` format. The first line in each file indicates the number of polling stations included in that file
* The folder `results` contains data bases generated from the `src/simulation.R` code
