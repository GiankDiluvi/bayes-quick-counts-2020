# Data folder

Here go all the data files used in the analysis.

### Roadmap

* Files starting in `REMESAS` refer to data from the Presidential election. The rest of the file names corresponds to a code `0100`, the day (`01` or `02`), and the time in `hhmm` format. The first line in each file indicates the number of polling stations included in that file
